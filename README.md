# Condooj

Condooj is a lightweight and small password manager. It is supposed to be portable and eventually will be compiled on all major OSes. It isn't a hard thing to achieve due to the fact that the code is almost entirely written in [nim](http://nim-lang.org/) language. Currently Windows(x86) is the only tested OS since I'm developing this application under Windows. it should be easy to compile it under linux too, and Mac OSX, well i dunno

The code is licensed under GPLv3 license.

##Version
0.1.0

##How to compile
all you need to do is to get the latest version of nim compiler and compile it and then use 'nakefile' with 'debug' or 'release' option to build the source code.
